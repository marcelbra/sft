1.
Adapter model creation with `add_adapter_model.ipynb`

2.
For every model in the target folder do inference on the previous next step predictions
Careful: make sure the previous next step predictions are done on training data!
See file `2. inference_command_previous_next_step_predictions.txt`

Once the final step is reached, predictions are done for all steps on test data.

3. Between steps create new teacher forcing data by using `tf.ipynb`
For that, use the function `create_tf_data_from_corresponding_model` and set the corresponding parameters.

4. Then, train the model with the new teacher forcing data
